## Description
<p>

RoboFriends is a responsive single page web application, allowing users to filter the Robots results data via the search form. 
<br><br>
Created with React App, connecting to a mock API from [JSON Placeholder](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) via a Fetch statement. 
<br><br>
The CSS is implemented with the [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io) NPM module (which uses a custom abbreviated CSS Class method to apply styling to elements).
<br><br>
Finally, [RoboHash](https://robohash.org) is used for generating the Robot Avatars.
<br><br>
This app is also 100% rated by Google Lighthouse testing (desktop).
